# Perspective
Perspective is a web application that aims to bridge the gap between different cultures at the University of California, Los Angeles. Through Perspective, we hope to create a hub for cultural exchange at UCLA and encourage students to engage in diverse activities, meet people with different backgrounds, and reflect on how different aspects and experiences shape one another.
